# Weather Dashboard
# Server-Side APIs:

This application is retrieving data from another application's API and using it in the context. 
Third-party APIs allow developers to access their data and functionality by making requests with specific parameters to a URL. 
This application will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS.

This application is using the [OpenWeather API](https://openweathermap.org/api) to retrieve weather data for cities. `localStorage` is used to store any persistent data.


## Criteria

```
This is a weather dashboard with form inputs that allows the user to search for a city.
When the city is searched, the user is presented with the current weather conditions of that city, as well as the future 5-day forecast.
After a city is searched, it is added to the search history. 
 
When the user views current weather conditions for the city they have searched, they are presented with the City's name, the current date, an icon that represents the weather conditions, the temperature, humidity, wind speed and the UV index.
The UV index is presented with a color that indicates whether the conditions are favorable, moderate or severe.
When viewing the 5-day forecast for the city, the user is presented with 5 future days what display the date, temperature, humidity and an icon to represent weather conditions.

The user is able to click a city within the search history and is then presented again, with the current and future weather conditions. 

Users last searched city forecast will be presented when weather dashboard is opened.
